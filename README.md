# 👋 Hi there! I'm Deepika P.

Welcome to my digital corner — a personal README that’s not just about projects or code, but about the journey behind it all. Think of this as a mix between a changelog and a coffee chat ☕✨

## 🙋🏻‍♀️ Who Am I?

### 🔐 Cybersecurity Explorer  
Currently navigating the ever-evolving world of cybersecurity while pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at **Shiv Nadar University Chennai**. I’m fascinated by how systems can be protected, broken, and rebuilt stronger.

### 🌱 Curiosity-Driven Learner  
I’m always asking: *“What’s next?”* Whether it’s exploring AI’s potential or understanding the ethics of data, I thrive on continuous learning and exploring what lies beyond the obvious.

### 🌍 Tech for Impact  
Technology, for me, is more than just innovation — it’s a responsibility. I’m drawn to work that sits at the intersection of **AI, cybersecurity, and sustainability** to create solutions that genuinely matter.

### 🎨 Creative Problem Solver  
I enjoy turning challenges into creative opportunities — whether it's in a hackathon, lab project, or just a late-night brainstorm. I believe that thinking differently is the first step toward building differently.
