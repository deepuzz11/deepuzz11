Welcome to my corner of the internet!  
Not your average README — more like a story in progress.  
A changelog of curiosity, creativity, and caffeine-fueled late nights. ☕💻✨

## 💡 About Me: A Work in Progress

### 🔐 Cybersecurity Adventurer  
Right now, I’m deep in the world of firewalls, forensics, and fascinating vulnerabilities —  
all while pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science at **Shiv Nadar University Chennai**.  
I love exploring the hidden layers of systems — how they break, how they heal, and how to make them bulletproof.

### 🌱 Curiosity is My Compass  
I follow the questions that keep me up at night:  
- What can AI do *ethically* in cybersecurity?  
- How do we build tech that respects privacy?  
- Can code be both powerful and kind?

### 🌍 Code with a Conscience  
My heartbeat lies where **AI meets cybersecurity meets sustainability**.  
Tech, to me, isn’t just about cool features — it’s about meaningful change.  
If it doesn't help someone or something, why build it?

### 🎨 Creativity Meets Code  
To me, a blank terminal window is like a blank canvas.  
I believe creative minds make the best problem-solvers — and some of my best ideas were sketched on napkins before becoming secure systems.
